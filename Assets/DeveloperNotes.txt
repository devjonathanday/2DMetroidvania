PROJECT SETTINGS
- Player settings should only enable even-numbered resolutions to prevent tearing between tiles.

MAP FUNCTIONALITY
- Spawn Points are contained on the Level Manager, starting from the uppermost door on the left wall, then going in a clockwise circle.
- The array containing the spawn points MUST be in the correct order to load properly.
- Destination Index is contained on the door, references the spawn point index in the next room to spawn from.
